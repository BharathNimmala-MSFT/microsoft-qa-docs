# Feedback and Ideas     
You can provide suggestions and give us feedback on Minerva, within Minerva. The Minerva team will evaluate the feedback and provide updates on each of the items. We encourage users to vote on the ideas or suggestions that will have the most impact on the platform.
## Ideas and Feedback Status
After you submit an idea or feedback, states indicate where your idea or feedback submission is in its lifecycle. As we take your feedback into consideration and move it along the workflow, we tag it with the corresponding states. The various states associated with feature suggestions are listed here, along with a description of their meaning and color indicators.<br/><br/>
