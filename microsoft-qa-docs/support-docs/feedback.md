# Site Feedback

You can provide suggestions and give us feedback on Microsoft Q&A on the site. The Microsoft Q&A team will evaluates your feedback in regular basis and provides updates along the way.

Note that this flow only applies for site feedback on Microsoft Q&A. For feedback on any other platform, please continue engaging in the sites you normally do.

## Voting

If you see some feedback already reported by others that you would like implemented, we encourage you to vote on those suggestions to make the most impact on the platform.

Note that you have 10 votes for all site feedback still in evaluation. Once the feedback is picked up or closed, you will get that vote back.
