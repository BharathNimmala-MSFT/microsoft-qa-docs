# Microsoft Q&A Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct applies to all users and posts in Microsoft Q&A. It outlines expectations for participation on this site.

The mission of Microsoft Q&A is a global, community-driven platform for timely, high-quality technical answers. Communities thrive through diversity of thought and the safety of its members. Microsoft has a deep-seated commitment to diversity and inclusion. Therefore, we are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. People violating this Code of Conduct may be banned from the community.

This Code of Conduct is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to capture our common understanding of a productive, collaborative environment. Where any aspect of this Code of Conduct conflicts with the [Microsoft Terms of Use](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/termsofuse), the Microsoft Terms of Use will take precedence.

## Member Qualifications

As a participant of this community, you agree that you will uphold this Code of Conduct and are responsible for all activities and content you post/upload. In addition to upholding this Code of Conduct, you are responsible for adhering to all applicable local and national laws.

This is your community. Help us to keep it safe, friendly, fun and helpful.

### Please do

- **Search before you post**. Search to see if a question you'd like answered has already been posted by somebody else. Posting the same question repeatedly and starting multiple threads on the same subject can be confusing. Members are busy and they spend some of their free time here to help the community. Someone will respond to your issue if they have the answer.

- **Be polite and respectful**. We are a world-wide community of professionals with different backgrounds, identities, and level of expertise. Remember you might not be communicating in someone else's primary spoken language, and others may not have your level of understanding.

- **Respect the site etiquette**. Use normal caps when you type. ALL CAPS typography is considered shouting and aggressive.

- **Learn from others**. We all make mistakes, and those should be seen as learning opportunities. If you post something that turns out to be incorrect and someone corrects you, thank the person instead of getting upset and lashing out at the person who corrected you. We are all here to learn and to improve ourselves.

- **Keep conversation threads on track**. When you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation. Stay on the topics of this site: technical questions and conversations on Microsoft technology.

- **Be honest**. Cite the source of anything you post or upload, if it isn't your own original content.

- **Understand disagreements**. Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful learning opportunities. Seek to understand the other viewpoints and resolve differences constructively.

- **Keep the community healthy**. Report any kind of abuse you find in the community. You will find a *Report* option in every post.

- **Post to the right place**. Is your question about Cosmos DB? Use the right tags. Using tags like #Azure and #CosmosDB help people understand what you are asking about. Moderators might update your tags or add new tags to better scope your question.

- **Mark correct replies as correct**. This helps ‘close’ the thread. It also helps others when searching for the right solution that the answer helped solve your problem.

- **Stay up to date**. Fine-tune your email notification preferences in your profile settings.

### Please don't

- **Threaten, stalk, insult, victimize, discriminate, or intimidate** anyone or any group of people for any reason; including on the basis of age, gender, disability, ethnicity, sexual orientation, race or religion.
- **Incite other users to threaten, stalk, insult, victimize, or intimidate**another person or group of people.

- **Harass, tease, or correct other users** about the grammar used in their posts. Good or bad grammar isn't the point-the community is about getting questions answered and technical discussions.

- **Post offensive material**, such as sexually explicit or violent material, content depicting nudity, of any sort, including full or partial photographic human nudity, or nudity in cartoons, fantasy art or manga.

- **Post content depicting nudity** of any sort, including full or partial photographic human nudity, or nudity in cartoons, fantasy art or manga.

- **Post sexually explicit or violent material.**

- **Use any behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.**

- **Post solicitation.**

- **Post 3rd party paid promotion**, including commercial software, freeware, freemium, with the exception of non-commercial open source.

- **Post links to websites that require payment to access information.**

## Microsoft Q&A User Cautions

Do not post sensitive data from your computer including memory dumps and/or configuration files. If you feel you need that to solve your problem, a moderator or a support person can start a private conversation with you to help you protect your data.

Be very cautious about accepting direct help from another user. If that user suggest he use Remote Assistance to help you, be aware that he will have access to your computer, and that your computer could be hacked.

If you volunteer to help another user through Remote Access, be very careful not to harm their computer in any way, or to access information that is not openly made available to you. Abuse of Remote Access will not be tolerated and will result in your being banned from the community.

Please be careful with your personal information. If you post your email address in a post, it may be used for any purpose by the general public, as this is a public community.

Don't post information that could be used by others to steal your identity, like your street address, your phone number, your social security number, or your credit card number.
