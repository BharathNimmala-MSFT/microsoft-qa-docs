## How do I earn Reputation points?
Points are earned by first participating and contributing positively to the community in this Q&A site. Then as others recognize your contribution (say by somebody accepting your answer as correct), youâ€™ll receive Recognition points.

There are many activities that award zero (0) points - those are listed to help you understand what we deem as quality contributions. Also note that not all activities in this list will appear in your activity feed; for instance negative actions are not listed publicly.
