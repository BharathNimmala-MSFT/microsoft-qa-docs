# Tag Creation Guidelines

## Guidelines when creating tags for Microsoft Q&A

- Reuse name Docs' slugs already in place in [Docs' taxonomy](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/new-hope/information-architecture/metadata/taxonomies?branch=master)
- Tags can have many-to-many parent-child relationship.
- All parent tags need to be from Docs taxonomy slugs in the above link.
- Provide additional tags based on scenario and tags used in other communities (such as Stack Overflow), your customers are already familiar with.
- Descriptions and icons for tags are optional

## Tag-naming rules

- Use lowercase only
- Use hyphen between words
- Don't use special characters (except for hyphens)
- Keep "Microsoft" out of the product name, unless there really needs to be an exception
- Make the tag name as compact as possible (ie: short “common-data-service-for-apps” to “common-data-service”).
- No product versions in the tags, unless there really needs to be an exception
