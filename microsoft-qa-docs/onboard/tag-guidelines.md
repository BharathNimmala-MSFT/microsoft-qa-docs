# Tag Creation Guidelines for Public Launch

The scope of this page is only for Q&A public launch on October 30. We will update this process with better recommendations based on the learnings that we have go through this first launch.

## Guidelines when creating tags for Microsoft Q&A launch

- Create a spreadsheet with all the tag elements: Parent, children, name, description (optional), and icon (optional). An example is [UWP](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/CE_APEX/Documents/APEX%20Online%20Team/Minerva/Public%20Launch/UWP.xlsx?web=1).
- If you want icons, please provide the link to the downloadable file.
- Reuse name Docs' slugs already in place in [Docs' taxonomy](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/new-hope/information-architecture/metadata/taxonomies?branch=master) as much as possible.
- Tags can have many-to-many parent-child relationship. I.e. a tag can be children of multiple parents.
- There is only a two-level hierarchy for tags. I.e. ony parent (L1) and children (L2).
- Tag hierarchy is transparent to the users, so repeat your service name in the L2 tags as needed.
- Provide additional tags based on scenario and tags used in other communities (such as Stack Overflow), your customers are already familiar with.
- Descriptions and icons for tags are optional. 

## Tag-naming rules

- Use lowercase only
- Use hyphen between words
- Don't use special characters (except for hyphens)
- Keep "Microsoft" out of the product name, unless there really needs to be an exception
- Make the tag name as compact as possible (ie: short “common-data-service-for-apps” to “common-data-service”).
- No product versions in the tags, unless there really needs to be an exception


## Process to request new tags (post going live)

***TBD***
