# Hub pages in Microsoft Q&A

We need to make sure that customers stay focus on their area of interest. For that, we wil use Smart Spaces in AnswerHub.

We are experimenting with Smart Spaces for Azure.

## Introduction to Smart Spaces

Smart Spaces pull together content based on filters related to different tags, users, content types, and search queries to display on a single page of the AnswerHub User Interface (UI). They are used as an additional form of organization within an AnswerHub community and are especially useful for browsing a mixture of content from multiple spaces.

Note: Users are not able to post content in a Smart Space, all content that appears in a Smart Space is populated from other Spaces in the community and based on pre-set filters.

### Smart Space Capabilities

- It is an aggregation of content of other spaces based on rules.
- It is a virtualized space.
- It appears in the drop-down space together with other spaces.
- Its content does not live in the smart space.
- It can have different CSS styles.
- It can have an icon.

### Smart Space Limitations

- It is not permission controlled. So, we cannot have further permissions than the space.
- It does not have a breadcrumb trail as it is not a physical container.
- We cannot show sticky content only for the smart space. You will see the site sticky posts.
- It provides a feed of the aggregated content. Te rest of the page does not change. For example, "Popular Tags" apply to the full site, not just to the tags include Smart Space.
