## Getting Started:

**Q. What is Microsoft Q&A?**

**A.** Microsoft Q&A is a global, community-driven platform for timely, high-quality technical answers. Q&A will be replacing MSDN and TechNet forums.

**Q. Why are we introducing Microsoft Q&A?**

**A.** We know how important it is for customers to have access to fast, accurate answers to questions about Microsoft technologies. However, MSDN and TechNet forums are outdated. To provide the set of capabilities that our customers need and want, we created a robust, scalable, and reliable new platform called Microsoft Q&A.

**Q. What are the major benefits of Microsoft Q&A versus MSDN and TechNet forums?**

**A.** Microsoft Q&A will use the same user authentication as Microsoft Docs and Learn content for a more consistent experience across the platform. This integrated experience will allow us to better prioritize and answer questions, and give users clearer paths between documentation, learning content, and answers. Microsoft Q&A also offers a much better set of permissions that will equip our moderators with improved tools.

**Q. How do I report a new feature or a bug for Microsoft Q&A?**

**A.** In the Microsoft Q&A header, click *Share your feedback*. Please search the existing feedback to see if the same idea is already proposed or the bug is already reported. If so, simply vote for the item. If the feedback is not yet reported, please create a new one. Our team will review it and update the status of the feedback item as it moves forward.
For more information about feedback, see: [Site Feedback][7].

**Q. What happens after I submit feedback for Microsoft Q&A? **

**A.** The Microsoft Q&A team will evaluate all feedback and provide updates on the status of each item. For more information on the feedback evaluation process, see: [Site Feedback][7].

**Q. Should I report product feedback on Microsoft Q&A? **

**A.** No. The feedback section on Microsoft Q&A is only for the site. For product feedback, please continue using the current channels.

**Q. Where can I report offensive content? **

**A.**

 1. On the offensive post, click the *Settings* icon.
 2. Click *Report*.
 3. From the drop-down box, select the right reason for the offensive post. Add additional information in the text box below it.
 4. Click *OK*.

A moderator will review this report and act on it.

**Q. Is this Q&A site mobile-friendly? **

**A.** The site is accessible and usable on mobile devices.

**Q. How do I create an account? **

**A.** If you have an account through Microsoft Docs or Learn, you can use the same account information here. If not, in the top right corner of the Q&A site you will see an option to create an account.

**Q. How do I sign in? **

**A.** In the Microsoft Q&A header, select **Sign In**. You can use the same user profile that you use on Microsoft Docs or Learn.

***

**Q. Can other users see my email address? **

**A.** No. Take a look at another user's profile and you'll notice that an email address is not listed. The same goes for users who look at your user profile.


## Asking and answering questions:

**Q. How do I ask a question? **

**A.** In the Microsoft Q&A header, click on *Post*. As you type in your question, we will show you similar questions that have already been askedâ€”make sure to investigate these because someone may have already answered your question. 

For more information on best practices when asking questions, please see the [Microsoft Q&A Code of Conduct][3].

**Q. How do I know if a response is correct? **

**A.** If the asker accepts a response as correct, it will be shaded green and marked "Accepted Answer". If not, look for answers that have votes, this means users have found those helpful.

**Q. How do I know if a user is knowledgeable? **

**A.** If a user participates in and contributes positively to the community frequently, they will build up reputation points. The more reputation points a user has, the more likely they are to have expertise on the topic they are commenting on.

**Q. How can I sort all the questions? **

**A.** At the top right of the questions pane there are five icons, giving you the option to sort the questions based on:

 - When the question was last updated
 - When the question was created
 - How popular the question is
 - How many votes the question has
 - How many views the question has

**Q. How do I answer a question? **

**A.** Under *Questions* in the header of the Microsoft Q&A site, you can filter the results to view all questions that have been asked, all unanswered questions, or recommended questions for you. Once you find a question you want to answer, you can write a reply at the bottom of the question's page. If the asker thinks the answer is correct, your response will be highlighted in green and marked as "Accepted Answer".

For more information on best practices while answering questions, see the [Microsoft Q&A Code of Conduct][4].

**Q. Who can answer a question? **

**A.** Anyone that participates in Microsoft Q&A. If you know the answer to a question, support the online community by answering it!

**Q. Can I vote my own posts? **

**A.** You can't vote your own questions, comments, answers, or feedback.

**Q. Can I vote on a post more than once? **

**A.** No, you can only vote on a post once.

**Q. Why do some questions show that they have no answer, but they actually do? **

**A.** The reason some questions appear unanswered before you click on them is because the answer has not been officially accepted. An answer is officially accepted when it is approved by the person who asked the question or a site administrator.

**Q. What are tags? **

**A.** Tags are topics related to your post that help group and organize all the content on Microsoft Q&A. You can add tags to any kind of post by searching from a wide range of topics at the bottom of a post that you are creating.

**Q. Do I have to add tags to a new question? **

**A.** Yes, the more tags you add the more information the community receives, making it easier to find similar questions and answer them.

**Q. Can I create a new tag? **

**A.** Users can't create new tags, however if you have a suggestion for a tag that you think would be helpful to the community please submit it [here][8].

**Q. How do I find a question like mine? **

**A.** In the Microsoft Q&A header, click on *Post*. As you start typing out your question you will see suggestions of similar questions. If you can't find anything that matches, try exploring the tags that are related to your issue.

**Q. How do I find tags that I'm interested in? **

**A.** In the search bar at the top of the screen, start typing out tags you are interested in. Related questions, users, and tags will be suggested for you to explore. You can also sort tags by popularity to see what the community is currently interested in.

## MSDN and TechNet forums:

**Q. What happens to the ongoing conversations in MSDN and TechNet forums that are closed to all new and existing posts ? **

**A.** You will still be able to view the forums, you just won't be able to ask new questions or create new responses. To understand how this change will impact you, see [Learn More][6] for more details.

**Q. Will the content from MSDN and TechNet forums be migrated into Microsoft Q&A? **

**A.** No. In the next few months, when a user searches for something that doesn't appear when they're browsing in Microsoft Q&A, we'll use machine learning to display read-only questions and answers from MSDN and TechNet forums.

**Q. Will I lose my MSDN and TechNet reputations? **

**A.** Currently you can't carry over your MSDN and TechNet reputation. However, in the future we'll give you the opportunity to link Microsoft Q&A and MSDN and TechNet forums. When this is an option, your current badges and points from MSDN and TechNet forums will be displayed as part of your Microsoft Q&A profile.

**Q. Can I keep the same user profile I have on MSDN and TechNet forums? **

**A.** To use Microsoft Q&A you'll need to make a new profile (though you can keep your MSDN or TechNet identity). The new user profile you will create for Microsoft Q&A will be linked to Microsoft Docs and Learnâ€”so if you already have an account for those sites, you can use the same one on Microsoft Q&A.

**Q. I'm a moderator in MSDN and TechNet forums, will I be a moderator in Microsoft Q&A? **

**A.** All moderators in MSDN and TechNet forums will be given the opportunity to continue being moderators. Stay tuned for more information about this.
