# User Experience Guides

We will focus on 3 key personas' scenarios and their experience:

1. [Askers](asker.md)
1. [Answerers](answerer.md)
1. [Moderators](moderator.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While Askers and Answerers personas focus on different scenarios, the permission level they will have in Microsoft Q&A platform will be the same, as Users. For a full list of permissions, see [Microsoft Q&A permission spreadsheet](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:x:/t/CE_APEX/ESBa0UT4rH9AklJPKsHOuNoBToDZKakeXuCIRtBABNtBMA?e=JayYyP)
